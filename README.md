Nitro Bootloader
================

This is a bootloader meant to allow DFU flashing of both bitstream and
other data (such as softcore firmware for instances) on FPGA boards where
a couple of the FPGA pins are used to implement USB through a softcore.


Limitations
-----------

The current code targets the iCE40 FPGA boards only.

A modified version was already used on the ECP5 for the Hack-a-day
badge 2019 supercon but the improvements still need to be integrated
here.

If you're interested in porting to other platforms, don't hesistate
to contact me.

Instructions
------------

If you are looking for the DFU bootloader. The build process is described in
the [ice40-stub README](gateware/ice40-stub/README.md).
